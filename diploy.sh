single line of dialogue is pushed
to the following page. A long
dialogue passage would be split -
but I’ll get to that later.
JOE
What about fonts?
APRIL
Courier, 12-point, 10-pitch. Make
sure it’s a non-proportional
version of Courier and avoid
Courier New unless you want your
script to be about 10% longer.
JOE
What about bold-face or italics? Or
a cool font like Garamond? I love
to jazz up my scripts.
APRIL
Mostly, you should steer clear of
bold and italics. Definitely no
Garamond, no Helvetica, no Times
Roman. Stick with Courier. That’s
the industry standard.
JOE
Ah . . . we’re talking about
industry standards.
Suddenly, Joe bolts from behind the podium
